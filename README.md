# comprobo_warmup

The intention of this project was to provide a practical introduction to learning
how to interact with Neatos (a Roomba like robot), using ROS2, the Robot
Operating System. The goal was to write scripts in Python using rclpy that
will allow the Neato to accomplish a certain set of behaviors. The five primary
behaviors we developed were teleop control, driving in a square, wall following,
obstacle avoidance, and person following.
